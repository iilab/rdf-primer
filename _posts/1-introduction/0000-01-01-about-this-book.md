This book is offered as a first attempt to understand what responsible data means in the context of international development programmes. We have taken a broad view of development, opting not to be prescriptive about who the perfect target audience is for this book. We also anticipate that some of the methods and lessons here may have resonance for related fields and practitioners.

We suggest a number of questions and issues to consider, but specific responsible data challenges will always be identified through individual project contexts. As such, this book is not authoritative, but is intended to support thoughtful and responsible thinking as the development community grapples with relatively new social and ethical challenges which arise from from data collection and use.

This book builds on a number of resources and strategies developed in academia, human rights and advocacy, but aims to focus on international development practitioners. As such, we touch upon issues specifically relevant to development practitioners and intermediaries working to improve the lives and livelihoods of people.

The group of contributors working on this book brings together decades of experience in the sector of international development. Our first hand experiences of horrific misuse of data within the sector, combined with anecdotal stories of (mis)treatment and usage of data having catastrophic effects within some of the world's most vulnerable communities, have highlighted for us the need for a book tackling issues of how we can all deal with data in a responsible and respectful way.

##Why this book?

What made 12 people descend upon a farmhouse in the Netherlands for three days, dedicating intense time and effort into creating this book from scratch?

It might have been an uneasy sense that the hype about a data revolution is overlooking both the rights of the people we're seeking to help and the potential for harm that accompanies data and technology in the development context. The authors of this book believe that responsibility and ethics are integral to the handling of development data, and that as we continue to use data in new, powerful and innovative ways, we have a moral obligation to do so responsibly and without causing or facilitating harm. At the same time, we are keenly aware that actually implementing responsible data practices involves navigating a very complex, and fast-evolving, minefield - one that most practitioners, fieldworkers, project designers and technologists have little expertise in. Yet.

We could have written another white paper that only we would read, or organised yet another conference that people would forget about. We tried instead to pool our collective expertise and concerns, to produce a practical guide that would help our peers and the wider development community to think through these issues. With the support of Hivos, Book Sprints and the engine room, this book was collaboratively produced (in the Bietenhaven farm, 40 minutes outside of Amsterdam) in just three days.

The team: Kristin Antin (engine room), Rory Byrne (Security First), Tin Geber (the engine room), Sacha van Geffen (Greenhost), Julia Hoffmann (Hivos), Malavika Jayaram (Berkman Center for Internet & Society, Harvard), Maliha Khan (Oxfam US), Tania Lee (International Rescue Committee), Zara Rahman (Open Knowledge), Crystal Simeoni (Hivos), Friedhelm Weinberg (Huridocs), Christopher Wilson (the engine room), facilitated by Barbara RÃ¼hling of BookSprints.net. Cover design by Henrik van Leeuwen, book design by Julien Taquet.

##About the title

Shooting a hard drive into space is one way - though not a very environmentally sustainable way - to get rid of data. It's also an easy, yet seemingly impossible measure, whose consequences we don't fully understand. Responsible data isn't all that different, especially within international development. We operate in an information environment that is powerful and dynamic, and in which the hype and seemingly infinite potential of technology can easily distract us from what might go wrong and what may be lost.

Although we find it easy to deal with extreme cases and dramatic happenings, the nuanced ethical implications of how data changes our relationships with stakeholders and partners in country are harder to track. This book doesn't provide answers to these challenges, but we hope it might help those seeking answers. We'll have to work towards answers as we continue to explore this new frontier. Hopefully, the book does provide some useful starting points, and points out a few exciting options (like the one in the title) that might not be the best responses.
